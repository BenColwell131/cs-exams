### High Level Description

K-Means Clustering uses a type of unsupervised learning, to create K groups of pixels in the image and pixels of the same color are drawn to the same group during an iterative process.

### Low level Description



### Pros & Cons

#### Pros
* Reduces the amount of colors in the image, which can be good for image compression.
* Reduces detail in objects that we are tracking so that they are easier to track.

#### Cons
