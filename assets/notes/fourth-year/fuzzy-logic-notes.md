# Fuzzy Logic Notes

## Introduction

**Soft computing** is an umbrella term for disciplines such as:  
* Fuzzy logic and fuzzy control,
* Neural networks based computing and machine learning
* Genetic algorithms
* Chaos theory in mathematics.

An example of a fuzzy set is the set of animals. A badger is an animal, a rock is not an animal, but it is not certain whether starfish or bacteria are animals.

A **Fuzzy Set** is a set which is defined so as to allow for imprecise membership criteria and for gradations of membership.

The term **Deviant Logic** is used to describe some systems of logic that are different to standard logic.

**Fuzzy Logic** is a system of logic for dealing with vague concepts.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Q5X0nTmrA) is a very good quick introduction to what this module involves.

A **Fuzzy Control** system is a control system based on fuzzy logic—a mathematical system that analyses analog input values in terms of logical variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or digital logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0.

**Heuristic** is an adjective that means 'Enabling a person to discover or learn something for themselves'.

When referring to **Heuristic Information**, what is meant is information based on ‘rules of thumb’.

One can be sure of the truth of an assertion such as "Jack is tall", as they can have confidence in the truth of a vague assertion, just because of its vagueness.

One can not be sure of the truth of an assertion such as "Jack is 1.876m tall", as the laws of physics acquire this minuteness of detail by sacrificing the fixed absolute certainty that comes with vagueness.

**Linguistic Variables** are variables whose values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial language.
