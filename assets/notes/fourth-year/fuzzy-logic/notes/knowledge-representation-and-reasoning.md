## Knowledge Representation & Reasoning

**Fuzzification** is the mapping of information onto the term-set of a linguistic variable.

**Inference** is the invoking of rules in a knowledge base systematically to determine which rules are fired and to what degree.

**Composition** is an averaging procedure used to compute the effectiveness of each rule.

**Defuzzification** is the process of converting fuzzy values onto crisp numbers.

A **Knowledge Based** expert system is a computer program which, with its associated data, embodies organised knowledge concerning some specific area of human activity.

A **Production System** is a knowledge representation based on condition-action pairs, called production rules or just productions of the form "If this condition occurs, then do this action".

A **Fuzzy Knowledge-Based System** is a knowledge-based system that performs approximate reasoning.

A fuzzy knowledge base comprises vague facts and vague rules, such as *X* is ùùª<sub>*x*</sub> or IF *X* is ùùª<sub>*x*</sub> THEN *Y* is ùùª<sub>*y*</sub>).
