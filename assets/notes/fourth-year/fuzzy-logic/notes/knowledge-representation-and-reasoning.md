## Knowledge Representation & Reasoning

**Fuzzification** is the mapping of information onto the term-set of a linguistic variable.

**Inference** is the invoking of rules in a knowledge base systematically to determine which rules are fired and to what degree.

**Composition** is an averaging procedure used to compute the effectiveness of each rule.

**Defuzzification** is the process of converting fuzzy values onto crisp numbers.

In Fuzzification, the membership functions defined on the input variables are applied to their actual values to determine the degree of truth for each rule premise.

A **Knowledge Based Expert System** is a computer program which, with its associated data, embodies organised knowledge concerning some specific area of human activity.

A **Production System** is a knowledge representation based on condition-action pairs, called production rules or just productions of the form "If this condition occurs, then do this action".

A **Fuzzy Knowledge-Based System** is a knowledge-based system that performs approximate reasoning.

A fuzzy knowledge base comprises vague facts and vague rules, such as <code>*X* is ùùª<sub>*x*</sub></code> or <code>IF *X* is ùùª<sub>*x*</sub> THEN *Y* is ùùª<sub>*y*</sub></code>.

*Fuzzy* or *vague* rules are linguistic rules that an antecedent/premise and consequent/conclusion. (e.g: `IF WARM THEN FAST`)


**MIN** and **PRODUCT** are two inference methods.

**MAX** and **SUM** are two composition techniques.

**CENTROID**, **MAXIMUM** and **Mean Of Maxima** are three defuzzification techniques.

 (TODO more on the last three points)
