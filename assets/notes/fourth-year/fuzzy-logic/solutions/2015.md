## 2015 Q2

### 2a)

Here are the membership functions for the input and output term sets:

**NEGATIVE:**
<code>𝝁<sub>NEGATIVE</sub>(x) = 1 if x ≤ -6</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>NEGATIVE</sub>(x) = (-3-x)/(-3-(-6)) if -6 < x < -3</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>NEGATIVE</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≥ -3</code>

**MIXED:**
<code>𝝁<sub>MIXED</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≤ -6</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>MIXED</sub>(x) = 1-(-3-x)/(-3-(-6)) if -6 < x < -3</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>MIXED</sub>(x) = 1 if -3 ≤ x ≤ 3</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>MIXED</sub>(x) = (6-x)/(6-3) if 3 < x < 6</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>MIXED</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≥ 6</code>

**POSITIVE:**
<code>𝝁<sub>POSITIVE</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≤ 3</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>POSITIVE</sub>(x) = 1-(6-x)/(6-3) if 3 < x < 6</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>POSITIVE</sub>(x) = 1 if x ≥ 6</code>

**SMALL:**
<code>𝝁<sub>SMALL</sub>(x) = 1 if x ≤ 1.5</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>SMALL</sub>(x) = (2.5-x)/(2.5-1.5) if 1.5 < x < 2.5</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>SMALL</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≥ 2.5</code>

I am assuming that `1≤` in the last column in the question was a mistake and was actually meant to be `≤1`.

**MEDIUM:**
<code>𝝁<sub>MEDIUM</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≤ 1</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>MEDIUM</sub>(x) = 1-(1.5-x)/(1.5-1) if 1 < x < 1.5</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>MEDIUM</sub>(x) = 1 if 1.5 ≤ x < 7</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>MEDIUM</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≥ 7</code>

**LARGE:**
<code>𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(x) = 0 if x ≤ 5</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(x) = 1-(7-x)/(7-5) if 5 < x < 7</code>
<code>𝝁<sub>LARGE</sub>(x) = 1 if x ≥ 7</code>

Here is the rule base governing the above mentioned SISO system:

Rule 1: IF X is NEGATIVE THEN Y is SMALL
Rule 2: IF X is MIXED THEN Y is MEDIUM
Rule 3: IF X is POSITIVE THEN Y is LARGE

### 2b)

For `x = -6`:

|Rule  |Firing Degree|
|------|-------------|
|Rule 1|            1|
|Rule 2|            0|
|Rule 3|            0|

Therefore we take it that Rule 1 is applied:
*"IF X is NEGATIVE THEN Y is SMALL"*

For `x = 6`:

|Rule  |Firing Degree|
|------|-------------|
|Rule 1|            0|
|Rule 2|            0|
|Rule 3|            1|

Therefore we take it that Rule 3 is applied:
*"IF X is POSITIVE THEN Y is LARGE"*

For `x = -4`:

|Rule  |Firing Degree|
|------|-------------|
|Rule 1|        0.333|
|Rule 2|        0.667|
|Rule 3|            0|

## 2015 Q4

### Q4a)

It makes sense that voltage would be applied to:  
* SLOW_DOWN the motor if it was going TOO_FAST
* SPEED_UP the motor if it was going TOO_SLOW
* Give the motor NO_CHANGE if it was going at an ABOUT_RIGHT speed

Using this knowledge and the membership functions of the term sets of the linguistic variables, I will draw fuzzy patches to represent rules for the rule base to control the behaviour of the electric motor.

The fuzzy patches are the cartesian product of the linguistic variables.

So as you can see, the rule base is:

IF SPEED is TOO_FAST THEN VOLTAGE is SLOW_DOWN
IF SPEED is TOO_SLOW THEN VOLTAGE is SPEED_UP
IF SPEED is ABOUT_RIGHT THEN VOLTAGE is NO_CHANGE
