## 2016 Q2

### 2a)

**Fuzzification** is the mapping of information onto the term-set of a linguistic variable.

**Inference** is the invoking of rules in a knowledge base systematically to determine which rules are fired and to what degree.

**Composition** is an averaging procedure used to compute the effectiveness of each rule.

**Defuzzification** is the process of converting fuzzy values onto crisp numbers.

### 2b)

1. Fuzzification:

*salary=140K & debts=60K*

Term|Linguistic Variable|Membership Value
---|---|---
s|Excellent_Salary(s)|1
s|Good_Salary(s)|0
s|Poor_Salary(s)|0
d|Small_Debt(d)|0
d|Large_Debt(d)|1

2. Inference & Composition:

*salary=140K & debts=60K*

|Rule number|Rule antecedent|Firing Degree|
|---|---|---|
|Rule 1|Excellent Salary OR Small Debts|1|
|Rule 2|Good Salary AND Large Debts|0|
|Rule 3|Poor Salary|0|

Rule 1 is the only rule that fires.

## 2016 Q4

### 4a)

To compute the membership functions, I will be using the exponential of half the difference between the ancestor and the daughter species, as suggested:

||Parent/Daughter|Grandparent/Daughter|Great Grandparent/Daughter|Great Great-Grandparent/Daughter|
|-------------|---|---|---|---|
|Distance     |  1|  2|  3|  4|
|Belongingness|exp(-0.5)=0.61|exp(-1)=0.367|exp(-1.5)=0.223|exp(-2)=0.135|

`Great Great-Grandparent =  {0.135/Pacific Lamprey, 0.135/Arctic Lamprey, 0.135/Atlantic Salmon, 0.135/Pacific Salmon, 0.135/Blue Shark, 0.135/White Shark, 0.135/Non-snake Lizard, 0.135/Snake-like Lizards}`

`Great Grandparent =  {0/Pacific Lamprey, 0/Arctic Lamprey, 0.223/Atlantic Salmon, 0.223/Pacific Salmon, 0.223/Blue Shark, 0.223/White Shark, 0.223/Non-snake Lizard, 0.223/Snake-like Lizards}`

`Grandparent =  {0/Pacific Lamprey, 0/Arctic Lamprey, 0.367/Atlantic Salmon, 0.367/Pacific Salmon, 0/Blue Shark, 0/White Shark, 0.367/Non-snake Lizard, 0.367/Snake-like Lizards}`

`Salmon-Parent =  {0/Pacific Lamprey, 0/Arctic Lamprey, 0.61/Atlantic Salmon, 0.61/Pacific Salmon, 0/Blue Shark, 0/White Shark, 0/Non-snake Lizard, 0/Snake-like Lizards}`

`Lizard-parent =  {0/Pacific Lamprey, 0/Arctic Lamprey, 0/Atlantic Salmon, 0/Pacific Salmon, 0/Blue Shark, 0/White Shark, 0.61/Non-snake Lizard, 0.61/Snake-like Lizards}`

### 4b)

**Salmon-Parent:**
