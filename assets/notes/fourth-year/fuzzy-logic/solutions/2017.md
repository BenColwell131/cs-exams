## 2017 Q1

### 1a)
It would be possible to describe the set of all Bertie's mammals as a crisp set, like this:
`A = {duck-billed platypus, echidnas, horses, zebras, tigers, whales, dolphins}`
This is a crisp set because all elements have total membership in the set of *mammals*.

However Bertie thinks that these animals are mammals to certain *degrees*. Using a crisp set like this to describe what he considers as being *mammal* loses this information. To include how Bertie feels these animals are mammals to different *extents*, the set of mammals would be better described using a *fuzzy set* like this:
`A = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 1/horses, 1/zebras, 1/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins}`

### 1b)
The Law of Contradiction states that `A ∩ Ã = ∅`. However for A<sup>mammals</sup>:
`A ∩ Ã = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 0/horses, 0/zebras, 0/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins,0/sparrows,0/robins,0/crows,0/penguins,0/kiwis}`
Therefore A<sup>mammals</sup> violates the Law of Contradiction.
