## 2017 Q1

### 1a)
It would be possible to describe the set of all Bertie's mammals as a crisp set, like this:
`A = {duck-billed platypus, echidnas, horses, zebras, tigers, whales, dolphins}`
This is a crisp set because all elements have total membership in the set of *mammals*.

However Bertie thinks that these animals are mammals to certain *degrees*. Using a crisp set like this to describe what he considers as being *mammal* loses this information. To include how Bertie feels these animals are mammals to different *extents*, the set of mammals would be better described using a *fuzzy set* like this:
`A = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 1/horses, 1/zebras, 1/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins}`

### 1b)
The Law of Contradiction states that `A ∩ Ã = ∅`. However for A<sup>mammals</sup>:
`A ∩ Ã = {0.5/duck-billed platypus, 0.5/echidnas, 0/horses, 0/zebras, 0/tigers, 0.1/whales, 0.1/dolphins,0/sparrows,0/robins,0/crows,0/penguins,0/kiwis}`
Therefore A<sup>mammals</sup> violates the Law of Contradiction.

### 1c)

The three most cited functions in the literature are:

**T-Norm**:  
Minimum: <code>T<sub>min</sub> = min(a,b) = a 𝚲 b;</code>  
Algebraic Product: <code>T<sub>AP</sub> = ab;</code>  
Bounded Product: <code>T<sub>BP</sub> = 0 V (a + b - 1);</code>  

**S-Norm**:  
Maximum: <code>S(a,b) = max(a,b) = a V b;</code>  
Algebraic Sum: <code>S(a,b) = a + b - ab;</code>  
Bounded Sum: <code>S(a,b) = 1 𝚲 (a + b);</code>  

The one main implication of using these triangular norms in fuzzy decision making is that defuzzification cannot be uniquely specified.

It can be verified that, for example by choosing different values of *a* & *b*, the following inequalities hold:  
<code>T<sub>BP</sub> ≤ T<sub>AP</sub> ≤ T<sub>mind</sub>;</code>  
<code>S<sub>max</sub>(a,b) ≤ S<sub>AP</sub>(a,b) ≤ S<sub>BP</sub>(a,b);</code>  
These requirements for T-norm & T-conorm functions cannot uniquely determine the classical fuzzy intersection and union (namely the min & max operators).

## 2017 Q2

### 2a)

**Note to student readers: This is the same as the [model answer](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lnfr37xev6ozm9l/AADSnjWY_82WSDjmggzTTb4Ba/CS4001-%20Fuzzy%20Logic/papers/Sample%20Answers?dl=0&preview=2014_CS4001_May+_Questions_ModelSolutionsExam.pdf), but I can't do any better than that!**

### 2b)

The velocity can be characterised by a trapezoidal membership function:

The **Core** of the velocity fuzzy set will be the values from *b* to *c*.

The **Support** of the velocity fuzzy set will be the values from *a* to *d*.

**2ci)**    
Crisp Statement: If A THEN B;  
Fuzzy Statement: If A(𝝭<sub>A</sub>) THEN B(𝝭<sub>B</sub>)  

**2cii)**  
Crisp Statement: A is_a_part_of B  
Fuzzy Statement: For all x of X, 𝝁<sub>A</sub>(x) ≤ 𝝁<sub>B</sub>(x)   

**2ciii)**  
**Note to student readers: I am unable to come up with how the following crisp relation could be translated into fuzzy logic in any sort of way. The difficult to decipher model answer can be found [here](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Khurshid.Ahmad/Teaching/Lectures_on_Fuzzy_Logic/Model_Answers.pdf#page=4).**  
Crisp Relation:  
```
A:= 5
If A < 5 then B:=A+5.
```  
Fuzzy Relation:  
```
TODO: ?
```

**2civ)**  
Crisp Statement: A weighs 5 kilo-grammes;  
Fuzzy Statement: A weighs about 5 kilo-grammes  

**2cv)**  
**Note to student readers: I have not been able to verify this answer.**  
Crisp Relation: Ā (donoting that A is false)  
Fuzzy Relation: 1-A to denote the fuzzy set Ā where 𝝁<sub>Ā</sub>(x) is 1-𝝁<sub>A</sub>(x).

**2cvi)**  
Crisp Relation: A belongs_to class B, so Ā does not belong_to B
Fuzzy Relation:  
In a fuzzy relation, this relationship is not true. In fuzzy logic:  
<code>𝝁<sub>A</sub>(x) ≤ 𝝁<sub>B</sub>(x) for all x of X</code>  
Does not necessarily mean that the following will not be true:  
<code>(1-𝝁<sub>A</sub>(x)) ≤ 𝝁<sub>B</sub>(x)</code>
