## Q1 (theory parts)

### 1a)
What is the Symbol System Hypothesis & what does it have to do with (✝)?
```
The hypothesis states that all reasoning can be expressed as symbol manipulation. 
This relates to (✝), as an intelligent agent can manipulate symbols. 
Therefore based on the hypothesis it is proposed that an intelligent agent can reason.
```
### 1b)
What does search have to do with non-determinism?

### 1c) 
State precisely the sense in which Cantors theorem says that
the set of infinite bit strings cannot be searched.

### 1d)
What is the problem SAT of Boolean satisfiability, and what does it have to do with finite bit strings?

### 1e)
How is exponentiation relevant to SAT and polynomial time computability?

### 1f)
What is a binary decision diagram (BDD), and what does it mean to be ordered and reduced?

```
A BDD is a rooted, acyclic graph with terminal nodes of the values 0/1. Branching depends on the boolean 
variable value of the node.

Ordered: A nodes variable index must be less than that of any of its children.

Reduced: High and Low children of a node cannot be the same. 
They must be opposite in order to arrive at a terminal node.

```

### 1g)
Give an ordered and reduced tree for the following Boolean expression...

### 1h)
What is a Turing Machine and what does it have to do with (✝)?

### 1i)
What is the Halting Problem and how is it relevant to (✝)?

### 1j)
What is SAT and how is it relevant to (✝)?

### 1k)
What is P vs NP and how is SAT relevant to it?

### 1l)
What is the Church-Turing thesis and what does it add to Symbol-System hypothesis in addressing (✝)?

### 1m)
What are the ingredients of a CSP?

### 1n)
What is the generate and test approach in CSP?

### 1o)
What does it mean for A* to be admissable, and what three things are necessary for A* to be admissable?

### 1p)
When is an ordered BDD satisfiable?

### 1q)
What do non-determinism and search have to do with (✝)?
