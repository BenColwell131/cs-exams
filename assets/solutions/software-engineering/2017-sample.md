## Q6)
We will **Study Documentation** so that we can become more familiar with the rules and practices of the financial sector.  
This needs no time commitment from users.  
It is hard to document the progress of this requirements elicitation technique.  

We will **Interview** the users of the system to find out what the issues are and what they want.  
This will encourage contact between the developers and users.  
This will be time consuming and the artificial environment may intimidate users.

We may consider **Naturalistic Observation** to see current practices that the project hopes to improve upon, although this may be time consuming.

We will not use **Questionaires**, as we do not understand the material enough to come up with the most appropriate questions to get useful answers for the project.  
We will not have **Focus Froups or Workshops** for similar reasons.  


## Q7)

### 7i)
5 Software Development processes are:
 - Waterfall
 - V-Model
 - Incremental
 - Prototyping
 - Spiral

### 7ii)

**Waterfall**:
 - Each phase must be completed before the next can begin.
 - It is easy to use and manage.
 - Each phase has specific deliverables which can be reveiwed for completeness.
 - It is difficult to go back to a previous phase, and does not suit long, on-going projects.

**V-Model**:
 - Each phase must be completed before the next can begin.
 - Focuses on verification and validation of Architecture and Design separately.
 - Testing design before coding avoids downward flow of defects.
 - No prototypes are produced, and any change requires a re-start of the entire model.
 
**Incremental**:
 - Produces multiple Waterfall cycles.
 - Every build results in working software.
 - Each deployed build must integrate with the previous ones.
 - The initial product delivery is fast and changes are easily made.
 - The cost may exceed Waterfall costs, and expert planning is needed.
 - The Architecture can suffer from the incremental building of the product.

**Prototyping**:
 - Deliberately creates incomplete versions of the product to recieve fast user feedback.
 - Good when the there is high ambigouity in the domain and the user cannot articulate what is exactly needed.
 - The client must agree upfront to use and review the incomplete software.
 - Active involvement in the development prevents future disappointment, errors and missing functionality are identified easily.

**Spiral Model**:
 - The Spiral model is risk driven. Every phase looks at eliminating the most dominant risks.
 - The spiral model is the most costly model.
 - Specialized expertise is required to implement the spiral model.

### 7iii)
The **Waterfall** model would not suit this project, as we need incremental versions of the system, and it is not suitable for long ongoing projects.

### 7iv)
As the clients are demanding an incremental release model, I think the **Incremental** development process is fitting, as it will allow the traders to use each release of the software as it is deployed.

## Q8)
The **Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified automatically. So it is a suitable pattern to update stocks on the devices of all interested traders.

## Q9)

### 9i)
 - Think out loud and record a list of problems
 - Measure users' efficiency and ease of learning
 - Observe the emotional state of the users
 - Ask usability experts and read usability guidelines
 - Organize the usability problems by importance to define areas to focus on.

### 9ii)
This takes place in the **Deployment phase** of the Incremental model, where the product is delivered and feedback is recieved.  
The measure of usability has an impact on the following **Communication phase** where there will be discussion on the problems regarding usability, and ultimately will impact the next **Modelling** phase.

## Q10)
We must adapt the following risk management processes:  
 - **Risk Identification**: List all risk events possible in a project.
 - **Risk Analysis**: Define probability of occurrence & potential for loss.
 - **Risk Planning**: Design preventitive measures to reduce the probability or the impact of each risk.
 - **Risk Monotoring**: Match the preventitive measures to the constantly re-calculated risks.

## Q11)
We will estimate by **Analogy** (comparing similar projects).  
We will also estimate by **Decomposition and Recomposition** by breaking the project up into smaller & smaller parts, estimating the size of each and summing them up.  

Once we have made substantial progress on the project, we can estimate by **Count & Compute**, finding the size of issues by calculating the average size of that issue over the course of the project.
