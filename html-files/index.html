            <p>This website is to help Computer Science students in Trinity to more efficiently navigate the past examination papers.<br><br>The questions for some of the modules have been split up into topics as well as possible.<br>Not all of the past questions have been put into a topic.<br>In some modules, it is more difficult than others to accurately separate questions into topics, so it is important for students to go through the past papers by year as well. <br><br>In most browsers (not Safari unfortunately), 'Questions By Topic' links will open up on the specific question in the pdf.<br><br><br>We hope you find the website helpful!<br><br><br>If you feel like splitting up past papers into topics for fourth year, or for beyond for exam years beyond the class of 2018 then:<br><a href="https://github.com/nating/trinity-cs-website">Make a pull request!</a></p>
